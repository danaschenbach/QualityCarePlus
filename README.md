# QualityCarePlus
This is a markup for a clinic. It's still a work in progress, waiting for additional info from client.
Currently the client has asked for a simple "business card" style webpage that shows both clinics.
Beyond what the client asked for I added a clickable link to google maps for directions. Added a
mouseover flip function to show the front of building associated with each clinic. Created my own logo 
with Vecter graphics for the banner.
- Todos:
  - Add marquee with clickable link for side business at footer
  - Animate flip for clinics
  - Add drop downs at top for different services(pushing to move side business here)
  - Once recieved, update images for clinics
